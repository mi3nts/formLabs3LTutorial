Now that your workspace is ready, letâ€™s connect the **Formlabs 3L / 3BL** to power and your network.  
Proper setup ensures stable printing and smooth communication with **PreForm** and **Dashboard**.

---

## Power Connection
1. Locate the **power inlet** at the back of the printer.  
2. Connect the supplied **power cable** firmly into the socket.  
3. Plug the other end into a dedicated **NEMA 5â€“20R wall outlet** (120 V, â‰¥8.5 A).  
4. Avoid using extension cords or shared power strips with high-power equipment.  

**Tip**: If possible, connect your printer to a **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**. This prevents failed prints in case of power fluctuations.

## Network Setup
Your Form 3L can connect via **Wi-Fi** or **ethernet** but we mainly use **Wi-Fi**


### Wi-Fi
1. Power on the printer (see below).  
2. On the touchscreen, go to **Settings â†’ Network â†’ Wi-Fi**.  
3. Select your network and enter the password.  
4. Confirm connection status on the screen.

## Network Requirements
To communicate with **PreForm** and the **Formlabs Dashboard**, make sure your network allows:  
- **UDP 9993** (for printer discovery)  
- **HTTPS 443** (for secure connections)  
- Access to: `api.formlabs.com`

Connect Printer to **AV** Wi-Fi
