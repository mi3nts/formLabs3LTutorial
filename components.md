# Printer Components Overview

Before installing anything, be familiar with the **Formlabs 3L / 3BL** components.  
Each part plays a role in reliable printing.

## Main Components
- **Resin Tank** – Holds liquid resin; slides into place on guide rails.  
- **Mixer (Mixing Arm)** – Keeps resin stirred for consistent prints.  
- **Build Platform** – The surface where prints form, attaches to the carriage.  
- **Resin Cartridges (x2)** – Feed resin automatically into the tank.  
- **Touchscreen** – Controls printer functions and shows status.  
- **Status Light** – Indicates printer state (pulsing white = idle, etc.).  
- **Power Button** – Located lower right on the front panel.
